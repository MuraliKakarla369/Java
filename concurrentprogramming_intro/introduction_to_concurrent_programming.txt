Hello,
In this module lets talk about Concurrency in java.

Firstly, we talk about some of the basic terminologies on concurrent programming.


Concurrency:
-------------
 
Concurrency means the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Imagine you can speak two distinct languages
(X,Y) and you want to deliver a message to group of people in which some can understand X and some Y.
You can switch between languages to deliver same message to both. In computer world the processor whether it 
may be single core or multi core, the ability to handle multiple tasks running simultaneously or with overlapping 
time periods is called concurrency.

Parallelism:
------------
Parallelism is the subset of concurrency which means the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously. In the 
above example you as a human cannot do the task i.e. delivering speech in both languages simultaneously but imagine a computer taking handling it. It can effectively play both audios at the same time.

Processor:
----------

It is the central processing unit of a machine(computer, mobile, tablet...) which acts like a brain to that machine 
helping in processing of tasks.
processor might be of type single core or often multicore, whatever the feature is it's main functionality is 
to do the given task. 
A Core is single processing unit, so in a multicore CPU we have several single processing units effectively communicating with each other and distributing work for a faster execution of a task.

Process:
--------

Any program or application that is running is called a process. A process has its own memory space and resources.
Processes are independent on each other. 

Thread:
-------

A thread is the smaller unit of execution within a process. A process may contain many threads performing different functions simultaneously to make that process faster. Threads share the memory and resources of 
a process which helps in thread communication.
