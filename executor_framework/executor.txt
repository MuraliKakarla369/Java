Executor:
_________

An executor is an object which executes a task submitted to it.Think of it like a shop owner who gives you the item you asked for.

It is an interface which has only one method in it that takes Runnable 
object.

pubic interface Executor {

   void execute(Runnable command);

}

If you pass a null object a null pointer exception will occur and if you pass a task that cannot be executed you will get a RejectedExecutionException.


Example that demonstrates the usage of Executor:

public class ExecutorExample {
	public void main(String[] args) {
		Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("task is running...");
		Executor executor = (Runnable command) -> command.run();
		executor.execute(task);
	}
}

It's that  simple that you don't need to create a thread manually and start them.
